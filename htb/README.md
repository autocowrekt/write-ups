# README

## General ##
The majority of these boxes were done as part of preparation to take the OSCP exam. I went back through my notes and created write-ups for each of them and additional information, screenshots, and links to external resources. I wanted to keep them concise and to the point while still showing enough detail/links/information to provide a clear path to get user and system/root on the boxes. 

All boxes were done without the use of Metasploit because as mentioned they were done in prepartion for the exam. I don't have anything against metasploit but I think more can be learned without it as it forces you to understand how various exploits work.

## Write-up Format ##

I try to follow a standard format for the write-ups. The overview gives a brief overview of the box, the software running, and how it was exploited. The enumeration info is listed at the top instead of being included in the steps to make it a little easier to read. This includes stuff like nmap scans, gobuster output, and software version info.
